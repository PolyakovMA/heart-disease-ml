This project consists of a single Jupyter Notebook that explores a small heart disease dataset and builds several classification models, including 
- Logistic Regression,
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
- Support Vector Machine (SVM),
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest.

The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of model performance.
